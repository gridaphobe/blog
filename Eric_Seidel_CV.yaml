    Summary:
      - "Architect and software engineer specializing in domain-specific languages, programming languages, and distributed systems. Built and evolved production Scala and Haskell platforms used by hundreds across engineering and investment teams, improving feedback loops, runtime performance, and cross-functional delivery."

    Experience:
      - company: Bridgewater Associates
        position: Lead Architect, Domain-Specific Languages
        start_date: 2021
        end_date: present
        highlights:
          - "Led evolution of a Scala DSL, shipping feature, performance, and tooling upgrades that accelerated authoring speed and improved runtime performance."
          - "Enabled AI-assisted development for DSL users by delivering context documentation and tooling tailored to common DSL authoring workflows."
          - "Drove migration of all DSL users from IntelliJ to VS Code, adding interactive execution and IDE integration that cut iteration time from minutes to seconds."
          - "Led greenfield design of a replacement DSL and production-grade compiler, and advocated a no-go decision based on delivery risk and cost-benefit analysis."
          - "Owned technical direction for a DSL platform used by hundreds of users, aligning roadmap and architecture priorities across business, product, and engineering."

      - company: Bloomberg
        position: Senior Software Engineer
