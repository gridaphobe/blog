Quick update on the status of [FluidCV][fcv]. I've added some documenation
to the home page, and opened the app to anyone with a [Fluidinfo][] account.
The resum√© creation process is not very user-friendly right now
(it basically requires major terminal work...), but I'm going
to add a web-interface as soon as I have time. I also plan to add the ability
to use custom html/css layouts eventually, but that will be further down the
road. So for those of you who are comfortable with command-line utilities,
try it and tell me what you think!

For more info on FluidCV, check out the [website][fcv] or my original
[post](/blog/2011/02/fluidcv/) about it.
