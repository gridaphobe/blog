If you use Google Reader to subscribe to my blog, you may have noticed
that the feed has been acting a bit crazy over the past few weeks,
with an increasing number of duplicate posts. Sorry about that, I was
rewriting my site in Haskell (using the [Snap Framework][snap]) and
royally screwed up migrating the feed. Since there's no apparent way
to reset one's feed on Google Reader, I've had to change my feed's URL
to <http://eseidel.org/feed>. Please update your subscription
accordingly.

You'll notice now that Google Reader claims all my posts
were published at the same time today... I've double-checked that the
feed (and timestamps) are valid, it must just be a bug in Google
Reader...
