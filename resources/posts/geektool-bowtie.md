So today I discovered two awesome utilities for customizing a Mac
desktop: [GeekTool][1] and [Bowtie][2]. GeekTool allows you to display
files, images, and the output of shell scripts on your desktop. It
seems to be very powerful, but I just used it to display the current
date and time. Bowtie is a nice, customizable remote for iTunes that
has tons of keyboard shortcuts and integrates with Last.fm. Combining
those two apps with a nice wallpaper and some tweaks to my dock, I was
able to make this.
